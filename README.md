I recently tackled the challenge of designing a small MNC network using static routing. This design ensures reliable data flow and provides a foundation for future expansion.

Key Components:
Routers: Core of the network, managing traffic flow and interconnecting subnets.
Switches: Connect devices within the same network segment, providing efficient communication.
Static Routing: Configured manually for each route, ensuring specific paths for data transmission.
This static routing setup offers a simple and effective solution for smaller networks with predictable traffic patterns.
